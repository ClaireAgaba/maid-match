# ✅ **Homeowner Profile Settings - COMPLETE!**

## 🎉 **Problem Solved**

Homeowners were seeing **maid-specific fields** (Professional Information, Documents) that weren't relevant to them!

---

## ✅ **Solution**

Created a **separate profile settings page** specifically for homeowners with only relevant fields!

---

## 📋 **What Homeowners See Now**

### **1. Profile Photo** 📸
- Upload profile picture
- Image preview

### **2. Account Information** 👤
- Username (read-only)
- Email (optional)
- Phone Number (required)
- Address

### **3. Home Information** 🏠
- Home Address
- Home Type (Apartment/House/Villa/Condo)
- Number of Rooms

## ❌ **What's Removed**

- ❌ Professional Information section
- ❌ Years of Experience
- ❌ Hourly Rate
- ❌ Skills & Services
- ❌ Documents section
- ❌ ID Document upload
- ❌ Certificate upload

**All maid-specific fields are gone!**

## 🔄 **Smart Routing**
